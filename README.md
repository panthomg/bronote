## About The Project

**BroNote: Engine Edition** is a fast, functional, and focused note-taking application designed for clarity and efficiency. It rejects the bloat of modern software and embraces a neo-brutalist aesthetic, prioritizing raw functionality over ornamentation.

Built with vanilla JavaScript and powered by Firebase, it provides a seamless experience with real-time cloud synchronization. Organize your ideas in nested folders, track your productivity with detailed stats in the "Engine Bay," and maintain full control over your data with easy backup and restore options.

This is your digital workspace, stripped down to the essentials. No distractions, just processing.
